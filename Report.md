## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

   To provide a significant addressing technique to a network -- allows specific addressing

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    Domain Name System -- translates domain names to IP addresses -- far more user-friendly than long IP addresses

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP does not change, dynamic IP changes over time

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP is more reliable, but UDP is faster and has less overhead

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event-based and runs behind the scenes -- delay will break this functionality

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Nothing else can happen while the function is running

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts allow functions to occur when a given condition/input is met without blocking other code to check for that input

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface is how a function is called, implementation is what that function actually does
